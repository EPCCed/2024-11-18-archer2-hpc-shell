## General Information

This lesson is an introduction to using high-performance computing systems
effectively. We obviously can't cover every case or give an exhaustive course
on parallel programming in just one lesson of teaching time. Instead, this
lesson is intended to give students a good introduction and overview of the
tools available and how to use them effectively.

By the end of this lesson, students will know how to:

::: checklist
 * Identify problems an HPC system can help solve
 * Use the UNIX shell (also known as terminal or command line) to operate a
   computer, connect to an HPC system, and write simple shell scripts.
 * Submit and manage jobs on an HPC system using a scheduler, transfer files,
   and use software through environment modules.
